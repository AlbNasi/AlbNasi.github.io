I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Bocconi University, Italy.


My main topics of interest are Urban Economics and Real Estate Economics.


My research has focused on the relationship between residential property prices, rents and their spatial distribution both within cities and between them.


I will be on the job market for the academic year 2025/26. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further inquiries or to connect.
