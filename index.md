I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Bocconi University, Italy.


My main topics of interest are Urban Economics and Real Estate Economics. I am also interested in Economic Geography and Trade Economics.


My research has focused on the relationship between residential property prices, rents and their spatial distribution both within cities and between them. 


I will be on the job market for the academic year 2025/26.
