## Work in Progress

### Mortgage Rates and the Price-to-Rent Ratio Across Space (JMP)				

This paper develops a parsimonious housing market model that conceptualizes residential real estate as both a non-tradable consumption good and an investment asset. The framework embeds households’ joint location–tenure choices, which shape local price-to-rent ratios. I test its predictions using a granular dataset of Italian housing prices and rents and a shift-share instrumental variable design exploiting heterogeneity in mortgage uptake across age groups. The results show that mortgage rate shocks induce spatially asymmetric responses in prices, rents, price-to-rent ratios, population, and tenure choices, consistent with the model’s implications. A structural estimation reproduces these heterogeneous effects and indicates that a positive mortgage rate shock alleviates spatial welfare inequality and narrows the divide between renters and homeowners.

### Property Taxation and Real Estate Price Dispersion.

I test the claim that property taxes reduce the price dispersion across properties of different quality thus reducing wealth inequality. I exploit the removal of the Italian property tax on main residences and its design to identify the effect of such tax on property prices. The results are consistent with the previous claims but heterogeneous in magnitude across different property markets. Additionally, I design a monocentric city model to connect the real estate asset literature with the urban economics one, and I find that the former has been ignoring two channels for the property tax to affect prices: the ability of households to switch between properties of different quality and its effect on the local consumption good bundle price.
